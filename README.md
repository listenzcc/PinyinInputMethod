# Input Method for BCI system

Try to build an easy-to-use input method for BCI system.
It will be a python-based, multi-word-libraries and chinese characters engine.

Wish me a good luck.

## Components

1. [Interface of Input](./Input_Interface)  
   Receive input letters and operate word typing.

2. [libraries of Word](./Word_Libraries)  
   Word libraries to be used.
   The common words sorted as frequency are restored.
